## Enumeration Members

### Constant

• **Constant** = ``0``

Defines that impulse is constant in strength across it's whole radius

#### Defined in

packages/dev/core/src/Physics/physicsHelper.ts:865

___

### Linear

• **Linear** = ``1``

Defines that impulse gets weaker if it's further from the origin

#### Defined in

packages/dev/core/src/Physics/physicsHelper.ts:867
